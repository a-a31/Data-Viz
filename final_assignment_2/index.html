            <span style="font-size: 150%;"> With the release of FIFA 23 recently and also the FIFA World Cup in a months time,
                I have made a data visualisation on FIFA 22. The following data visualisations display a few analysis of players,
                their attributes including their overall ratings, their value, their country of origin and also exploring their potential.

<div class="sub-text">
    <span style="font-size: 150%;"> As a player gets better over seasons, their rating increases. This also means 
        their <span style="font-weight:bold">value </span> increases. Given in Euros, the following scatterplot shows the 
        correlation between a player's rating and their value.
</span>

<span style="font-size: 150%;"> Note that AM stands for attacking-midfielder, CB for centre back (defenders), CDM for defending-midfielder
    , GK for goalkeeper, MID for midfielder and ST for striker.

<div class="sub-text">
    <span style="font-size: 150%;"> As players tend to get older, it is a common thought amongst the public/fans that 
        their performance and ratings drop. Please <span style="font-weight:bold">click</span> on a position from the bar chart to view filtered data.
